# Instructions
# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
# Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
# DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.
# DO NOT write any print statements.
# This is the scoring criteria:
# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
# Expected Output
# '{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'

  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,

for student in student_scores:
    scores = student_scores[student]
    if scores > 90:
        student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
    elif scores > 80:
        student_grades[student] = "Exceeds Expectations" 
    elif scores > 70:
        student_grades[student] = "Acceptable"  
    else:
        student_grades[student] = "Fail"

    

print(student_grades)


#For loop only gives the keys. So we make a variable scores to store the scores. After which we use the for loop to get the scores. After which we use the if statements to use conditions to find the stright outputs which we later store in student_grades, which is our list. It later gets printed the desired output.
