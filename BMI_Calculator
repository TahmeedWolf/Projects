# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.
# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

# "Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."
# "Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."
# "Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."
# "Your BMI is 33, you are obese."
# "Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."


height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))




Bmi= float(weight)/(float(height)*float(height))
Bmi_rounded= round(Bmi)
if Bmi_rounded<18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {Bmi_rounded}, you are underweight.")
elif Bmi_rounded <25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {Bmi_rounded}, you have a normal weight.")
elif Bmi_rounded <30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {Bmi_rounded}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif Bmi_rounded <35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {Bmi_rounded}, you are obese.")
else:
 print(f"Your BMI is {Bmi_rounded}, you are clinically obese.")
